PIXART
A JS Painting Website

In this exercise, students will build out a simple paint application. This
application will have a form where users can set a color that they would like
to paint with. The user can then mouse over cells that they would like to paint
with that color.

*/



/*

Step 1: Building the canvas
Our canvas is 500px by 500px and we need to fill it with cells (wich a class of
.square) that are 10px by 10px.

First, add however many divs with a class of "square" as you need to to fill
our the #canvas element.

If #canvas is 500 x 500, how many 10 x 10 squares can we fit in to it?

How we we create elements in JavaScript and add them to the page?

*/


let canvas = document.querySelector('#canvas')

for (let i = 0; i < 2500; i++) {
  let div = document.createElement('div')
  div.classList.add('square')
  // div.addEventListener("mouseenter", paintSquare) // we can add the event listener here, if we want
  canvas.appendChild( div )
}


/*

Step 2: Form Event
When the user submits the form, either by hitting enter in the text
input field or by clicking on the submit button, we should then get
the color value that they entered and save it to a variable called
currentColor.

Once we have the color, we should update our .brush element, so
that the user can see what color they're painting with at any given
time.

hints:
(1) you may need to look up form specific events,
(2) you may need to avoid the browser's default behavior when
submitting a form,
(3) you should query for the input field from the event target
(4) once you have the input field, it's current value is stored in
the value property

*/

let myForm = document.getElementById("form")
let brush = document.querySelector('.brush')
let currentColor = "green"

myForm.addEventListener('submit', function( e ) {
  e.preventDefault()

  currentColor = e.target.querySelector('input').value
  brush.style.backgroundColor = currentColor
})



/*

Step 3: Readying our Canvas
Now that we can get the color the user wants to paint with from our
form, we need to make it so they can actually paint with that
color. Create an event handler that will change the background
color of the event target to the current color and attach it to
every div.square that you created made above.

Hints:
(1) you probably want to write your function here and then attach
the event in your loop up in Step 1
(2) think about what event we might want to attach our event
handler too; what mouse events are there that might make sense?

*/

function paintSquare( e ) {
  e.target.style.backgroundColor = currentColor
}


/*

A note on the event handling and event propogation

I mentioned event propogation in class. When doing something like
this, you have two options:
1. Get every div with a class of 'square' and add the same event
to each one.
2. Attach an event listener to the parent element and then style the
specific square using `event.target`.

Follow up notes:
- we're already looping through our divs above when we create
them, so if we're going to add the event to each individual
square, why not add the event there?
- there are a lot of differet kinds of events. If we want to add
the event to the canvas element, we can't use 'mouseenter',
because that will only fire when the mouse enters the canvas and
our event target will be the canvas.

*/

canvas.addEventListener('mouseover', paintSquare)
